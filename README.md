This project was submitted to the InsightData Engineering Team. My main program is written in C. It consists of a single file main.c present in the src folder. This program needs two files percentile.txt and itcont.txt which are to be saved in the input folder. The final output is the text file named repeat_donors.txt which will be saved in the output folder. 

run.sh compiles the code and executes it. The program works for the example provided. 

The current working directory needs to be setup to execute this code. Otherwise, execution of this code will give Segmentation fault as error.
